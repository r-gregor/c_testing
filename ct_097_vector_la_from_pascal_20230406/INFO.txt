Work flow:
- first construct everything for 2D,
- then rearange everything for 3D:
- then copy everything as 3D (copy and rename Vec2_ to Vec3, ...),
- then update 3D constructors to accept third parameter 'z', and
- everything else (all the functions returning a vector) stays the same!
- Then rearange everything for 4D (same as rearanging for 3D):
- then update 4D constructors to accept fourth parameter 'w',
- everything else (all the functions returning a vector) stays the same!
- ... possible because vector components initialized as lists and operated on with for loop ...
- Then construct main entry point: main.c,
- ...
