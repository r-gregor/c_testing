# 0.3.0-dev

# 0.2.0 — Removing Everything

*2021-01-30*

- Introduced `ENDS_WITH(str, postfix)` function that checks if `str` ends with `postfix`.
- Introduced `IS_DIR(path)` function that checks if `path`is a directory.
- Introduced `RM(path)` function that removes the specified path. It does not care if the path is file or directory, it just removes everything recursive every time.

*2021-01-27*

- Introduced logging functions `INFO(fmt, ...)`, `WARN(fmt, ...)`, `ERRO(fmt, ...)`.

## Deprecations

All the deprecated functions and macros will be removed in the next major release.

- `remove_ext(path)` is deprecated. Use `NOEXT(path)` instead.
- `CONCAT_SEP(sep, ...)` is deprecated. Use `JOIN(sep, ...)` instead.
