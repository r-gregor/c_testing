// - size will always be 1
// - nmemb is the number of chars/bytes received, the "number of elements"
// - user data will be a pointer to the Response struct in main BECAUSE we 
//   set it to be so using CURLOPT_WRITEDATA.

// the libcurl library will stop the transfer.

	// Append the new chunk of char data to the existing string using memcpy.  The
	// source is set to the memory address of the last index in the existing 
	// string so that we begin copying the new chunk here.  This last index will 
	// be the null terminator of the existing string (unless it is the first time
	// that write_chunk is called, in which case we have no string data stored
	// yet).  We copy to this "source address" from the destination address "data"
	// where the chunk is stored, copying the size of the chunk (real_size).
