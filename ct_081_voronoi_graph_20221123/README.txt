Description:
Voronoi diagrams are Proximity diagrams (regions of points around the seed point that are closer to seed than
any other point --> which is closer to some other seed point: voronoi cell).

From Wolfram Math: The partitioning of a plane with n points into convex polygons such that each polygon
contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point
than to any other. A Voronoi diagram is sometimes also known as a Dirichlet tessellation. The cells are
called Dirichlet regions, Thiessen polytopes, or Voronoi polygons.
